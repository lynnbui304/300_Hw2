Input:
dat = DNA pattern
k = k-mer length searched for
d = max hamming distance
print(FrequentWordsWithMRC(dat,k,d))

Output:
[M, {'pattern_1': [array_1], 'pattern_2': [array_2], ..., 'pattern_N': [array_N] }]

M = Largest score for any k-mer with a hamming distance up to d

{'pattern': [array]} = a 'pattern' with a score of M and an [array] of each 
position it was found in dat

Potential DnaA boxes for Vibrio Cholerae with k-mers of 9, Hamming distance of 0 is:
[6, {'ATGATCAAG': [27, 127, 508], 'CTTGATCAT': [397, 468, 525]}]
=> The largest score for pattern 'ATGATCAAG' and its reverse complement 'CTTGATCAT' is 6. 
=> The times that the pattern and its reverse complement appearing should be the same. In this case, it is 3 times. 
Pattern 'ATGATCAAG' appeared at index 27, 127, and 508; its reverse complement 'CTTGATCAT' appeared at index 397, 468, and 525.  

Potential DnaA boxes for E.Coli with k-mers of 9, Hamming distance of 1 is:
